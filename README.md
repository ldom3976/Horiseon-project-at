Code Refactor
I have refactored the code by meeting the standards for web accessibility  I have improved the codebase to make sure links are working appropriately and search engine optimization is also improved. 

I also consolidated CSS selectors to be more efficient and the style sheet was cleaned up to follow the structure of the HTML file and be more organized.
